## Sharing is caring
For long I had a complicated relationship with writing about things I do and like. I didn't get into the
habit of using social medias; Most of the people I knew wouldn't really have understood what I was
talking about. Being in a sort of vacuum with my thoughts and hobbies had a negative effect on my productivity
and enjoyment, and I started feeling stuck and unmotivated.

Once I found computer graphics, I found an easy way to document my progress (**print screen**) and I felt
the difference it made. This, in addition to finding a really interesting and fulfilling subject recreated my
enthusiasm. I had something concrete to show my progress with and it was in a form I could easily enjoy in the
future, instead of a backlog of useless github repos not to be touched again.

## Writing
Sometimes pictures aren't enough and you need something to help out. Writing things down deepens your
understanding and gives you an opportunity to view things from other angles. Words, in writing or speech,
forces one to look at the thoughts and validate if they make sense or not. If they do not, you now have an
opportunity to rearrange and reform them until they do. This makes writing in itself beneficial. It is a skill
however and needs conscious effort and time, not just a wish, to improve in.

Writing for yourself shouldn't be an excuse to publish unpolished and useless content (a lot of the skill
is in making it interesting, and getting better at it is one of the goals). Instead it should be used as
motivation, to do something for yourself. When you remove the need for an audience you can focus on doing and can
get started. Realising this has been helpful in many things.
