## Me
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/about01.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="Picture of me" /></span>
I'm a programmer, currently working in the entertainment industry, around professional media servers.
In my life I like a mixture of technology and art.
Luckily those are quite easy to combine. Games and other computer graphics related endeavours are the perfect
outlet for my exploratory and creative needs.

## Code
I've been toying with code, tech and similar things ever since I can remember. It has had a huge impact in the way
I see the world and how I think. It has been hard to find a thing to focus on in a place with so many
interesting areas and problems to solve!

## Games
Games, especially the video kind,  have played a huge role in my life. I've always been playing games and I don't see it ever stopping.
They can create narratives worthy of books, visuals that rival movies and companionship that lasts for decades. Games are neat.

## Things
I've done some other things as well! I used to be involved in local theatres, towards the end mainly as the only sound and light tech.
At 8 years old I started playing piano and music has stayed with me. Sometimes I take a walk or drink coffee. I might draw a thing.
Reading books is nice.
