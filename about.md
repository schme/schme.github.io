## Me
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic02.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="Me with a flower" /></span>
I'm a 27 year old Computer Science student from Helsinki. In my life I like a mixture of technology and art.
Luckily for me those are quite easy to combine. Games and other computer graphics related endeavours are the perfect
outlet for my exploratory and creative needs.

## Code
I've been toying with code, tech and similar things ever since I can remember. It has had a huge impact in the way
I see the world and how I think. It has been hard to find a thing to focus on in a place with so many
interesting areas and problems to solve!

## Games
Games, especially the video kind,  have played a huge role in my life. I've always been playing games and I don't see it ever stopping.
They can create narratives worthy of books, visuals that rival movies and companionship that lasts for decades. Games are neat.

## Things
I've done some other things as well! I used to be involved in local theatres, towards the end mainly as the only sound and light tech.
At 8 years old I started playing piano and music has stayed with me. Sometimes I take a walk or drink coffee. I might draw a thing.
Reading books is nice.
