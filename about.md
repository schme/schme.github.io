## Me
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/pic02.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="Me with a flower" /></span>
I'm a 27 year old Computer Science student from Helsinki. In my life I like a mixture of technology and art.
Luckily for me those are quite easy to combine. Games and other computer graphics related endeavours are the perfect
outlet for my exploratory and creative needs.

## Code
I've been toying with code, tech and similar things ever since I can remember. It has had a huge impact in the way
I see the world and how I think about the Universe. It has been hard to find a thing to focus on in a place with so many
interesting areas and problems to solve!
