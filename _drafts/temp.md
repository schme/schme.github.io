## Start
When I started programming, I did it with Vim and a console. I picked up Python and went over towards C. I made websites like this. Html, CSS and
Javascript, all through my editor, command line and a browser. This was easy and quite simple. I understood what was going on. I could write command line
scripts for things I knew would be done often. The workflow was almost identical no matter what I was doing.

##
Sometime after I learned about IDE's. I spent time searching for the best one and learn it. I learned about build tools. Make, CMake, Maven, Gradle, Travis..


## Frameworks
